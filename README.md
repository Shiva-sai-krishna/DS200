# DS200
A repository for my DS200 course where I save the plots, colab notebook and datasets. 

The dataset provides timeseries data for the rainfall observed for different regions in India. The timeseries consists of yearly, monthly and seasonal data. Rain in Bangalore is interesting, fun and sometimes annoying. The dataset is provided in the official govt website, and my public repository for the DS200.
